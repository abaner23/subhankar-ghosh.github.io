## Projects

I was extremely blessed to be part of the following projects through which I have learnt a lot. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those people who have helped me in doing the following projects and whet my skills.

### Curb Domestic Violence
*Feb 2016 – Dec 2016*

In this project we aimed at detecting domestic violence via an app which recorded sound and through Azure stream analytics the information was being transmitted to an algorithm hosted in AzureML that classified it as domestic violence or not. If domestic violence was detected immediate help was sent. This project is still being researched by the Makerz Bay (Innovation Hub of Microsoft India, Hyderabad).
  We had **presented a paper based on this project in  Microsoft Machine Learning, Analytics & Data Science Conference, Redmond, 2015.**
  
  Factors taken into account were analysis of text extracted from the speech using speech to text APIs in Cortana Analytics. Text analysis was done using NLP techniques and deeplearning algorithms. 
  Another factor was the decibel level of the sound that was recorded.

We had used: Python, Azure Stream Analytics, Azure ML, Text mining and classification, Speech to text in Cortana analytics suite.

### Azure Virtual Architect
*Mar 2016 – Jun 2016*

Azure provides multiple solutions for each problem. So many architectures can be built on azure with different cost,efficiency and performance. This virtual architecture takes the requirement as different input parameters and recommends the most optimum solution. Input was given as raw text and we used nltk to parse the input. 

   We crawled azure docs and using text mining we built the training dataset. The input features are now mapped to output design via cosine similarly and euclidean distance. This project was done when I was a part of Microsoft R&D India with team mates Swaraj Khadanga and Anubhav Panda.
   
### Let's Envisage
*Aug 2015 – Jun 2016*

In a developer environment, utilizing the developers efficiently is the key to improve their productivity and team's performance overall. Presently, senior members assign work items to developers mostly based on intuition. Hence, the estimated time set by senior members within which the work item needs to complete may be inaccurate resulting in either overloading or under-utilizing the developer. Our tool makes sprint planning a lot simpler by guiding the senior member to allocate task to the correct developer and to provide better time estimates for work items, thereby efficiently managing the available resources. The tool also takes a list of work items planned for a particular Sprint and efficiently assigns those work items to members of the team depending on the difficulty of the work item, experience and time availability of the members of the team.

  We had **presented a paper based on this project in  Microsoft Machine Learning, Analytics & Data Science Conference, Redmond, 2015.** 
  A patent is filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office with the name **EFFICIENT TASK PLANNING USING PAST PERFORMANCE.**
Made use of: Python, C#, SQL, Regression analysis techniques.

### Characterization of mammograms using classification techniques for breast cancer detection
*Aug 2014 – Mar 2015*

This was my research project in NIT Rourkela while my B Tech. Breast cancer is one of the most rapidly spreading cancers in the world today and so an efficient and accurate method for detecting it is necessary. This project aims at designing and implementing a computer aided model for efficiently and accurately determining from a given mammogram(xray images of women breasts) if it has cancer or not, if yes then its extent accurately.

   In this project my role is that of a research assistant where my work is for devising an appropriate data preprocessing technique and classification technique which will classify the mammograms accurately.
Skill Used: MATLAB, WEKA, programming, datamining techniques, classification.
