###Curb Domestic Violence

Feb 2016 â€“ Dec 2016

In this project we aimed at detecting domestic violence via an app which recorded sound and through Azure stream analytics the information was being transmitted to an algorithm hosted in AzureML that classified it as domestic violence or not. If domestic violence was detected immediate help was sent.

  Factors taken into account were analysis of text extracted from the speech using speech to text APIs in Cortana Analytics. Text analysis was done using NLP techniques and deeplearning algorithms. 
  Another factor was the decibel level of the sound that was recorded.
This project is still being researched by the Makerz Bay (Innovation Hub of Microsoft India, Hyderabad)
We had used:
* Python
* Azure Stream Analytics
* Azure ML
* Text mining and classification
* Speech to text in Cortana analytics suite
